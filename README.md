# Obsidian Prompts

Dear Visitor this whole folder is an Obsidian Vault. Please clone it and open it in Obsidian. 
Please also install the Obsidian addons:
- TikZJax
- Zotero Integration
- Smart Connections

Obsidian will ignore all files that are not Markdown or Pdf.

## What one can do with this repository:

in the folder Python and Javascript there are various scripts, that can:

- Parse and chunk a Pdf or tex file into small chunks.
- Take those chunks and create cards for Obsidian with it
- Create Ankidroid cards for spaced repetition

Please look into the individual documentation of the file to see what it can do.


## how to setup the environment:
Just run `nix develop` to get into the nix/pixi shell


## How to run the scripts:

- Python: pixi already sets up the environment: just `python filename.py --additional_arguments`
- TypeScript: `run --arguments` with deno
